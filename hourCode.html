        <h2>Hour Of Code</h2>
        <p>
            On November 1, at 12:30, we, team 52 - Hamida Jafarova, Mahammad Khammadov, Murad Orujov, Nihad Orujlu, held an Hour of Code event at Baku Oxford School. 20 students of the 8th grade participated in the event. We started our event by introducing ADA University. We gave a brief introduction to computer science and talked about how coding is actually for everyone and any age. Students then completed a 15-task Star Wars puzzle and received theirÂ certificate.
            As such, the main concern at Hour of Code involved promoting a fun learning process of coding to the 8th graders. The aim was to make coding fun and interesting by taking puzzle-based coding tasks with Star Wars as the theme.

            Differences in the coding level of participants forced teamwork and collective learning. The progression from basic to more advanced tasks catered to the diverse skill levels of the participants.
            In the week before the event, we conducted thorough research on coding activities suitable for beginners. 
            One notable challenge was the varying skill levels of the participants. Technical challenges, such as compatibility issues with the coding platform and participants' devices, were also faced because students had different laptops and experienced difficulty with creating accounts, but we dealt with these issues, in the introductory part when half of the team was presenting and others helped with registration. 
            We Team 52 want to thank Baku Oxford School for providing the technical, logistical, and organizational support for Hour of Code. The cooperation and enthusiasm of the school staff contributed significantly to the success of the initiative.
